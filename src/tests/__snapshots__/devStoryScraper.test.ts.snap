If we gave you a quick programming assignment, which would you prefer — writing an iOS app, or an Android app? You should go with the one you’re stronger in.”</p>

<p>I’m a much stronger iOS programmer than an Android one. The smart move would’ve been to answer “iOS,” and be done with it.</p>

<p>Instead, I replied “Yes, but you want a guy who can lead a team of both iOS and Android developers. You really should give me both.”</p>

<p>The CTO raised an eyebrow, gave me a look, made a note on his pad, and said “Hmmm...I think I will.”</p>

<p>This is either a “total baller move” (to borrow a turn of phrase the kids are using these day), or the end of that job prospect. But for the job that they’re trying to fill, taking on that challenge was the right thing to do.</p>

<p>It had been a couple of years since I’d touched C or Objective-C, but after bumping my head once or twice against C-isms (“Oh yeah, pointers”), I got into a groove and a few days later, I had an app that I could show them.</p>

<p>I sent them my project files for the iOS app, along with this “highlight reel” of the app in action, which I made using Camtasia Studio. “Tell me what you think while I work on the Android version.”</p>

<p>And that’s the last I heard from them. Follow-up emails were met with silence. After the 6th email (“If you have any questions or comments about the app, please feel free to contact me”), it became apparent that this was a dead end, and it wouldn’t be worth my while to continue working on the Android version. Perhaps I’ll work on it as a way to sharpen my Kotlin skills.</p>
