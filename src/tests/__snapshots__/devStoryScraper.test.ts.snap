*   Owned and delivered a major upgrade to the [Android version of Lilypad](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.lilypadsolutions.lilypadappV2&hl=en_US), bringing it to feature parity with the iOS version. I was also working on improving the performance of the Android version so that it would be on par with the [iOS version](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/lilypad-sales/id921371352). Cleaned up the Android user interface and started making performance improvements that made some features 60% faster.
*   Fixed bugs, upgraded existing capabilities, and added new features to the app. Built apps for both iOS and Android in JavaScript using [Axway’s](https://www.appcelerator.com/) [Titanium](https://www.appcelerator.com/Titanium/) SDK (formerly known as Appcelerator Titanium).
*   Took charge of internal developer documentation. While Lilypad’s back end and web application were written by senior developers, the mobile app’s 360,000+ lines of source code were largely written by junior developers and interns. With managerial approval, devoted 20% of development time to writing much-needed internal documentation of the mobile app, refactoring the code, and upgrading it to a more current version of JavaScript.
*   Established coding standards for the mobile app. The mobile code was developed by a series of junior developers, each coding in their own style. Defined a standard to be used for mobile development and have applied it to the codebase during development.
*   Built a new mobile process and team: Key participant in weekly mobile development strategy meetings with the CTO to improve the mobile app development process. Interviewed developers for the mobile team.",

It was a peer-to-peer encrypted proxy system that circumvented internet censorship systems such as “The Great Firewall of China”, and has since been supplanted by VPN and similar anti-censorship technologies.

Even though it was announced, the project wasn’t actually implemented until Paul Baranowski and I worked on it starting December 2001, and presented it at the CodeCon conference in February 2002. Paul was the back-end developer, building the underlying networking software, while I was the front-end developer, and built and designed the user interface, which included the cute bear icons that the screen used to show other users on the network.

Peekabooty got a considerable amount of press at the time.
