*   Owned and delivered a major upgrade to the [Android version of Lilypad](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.lilypadsolutions.lilypadappV2&hl=en_US), bringing it to feature parity with the iOS version. I was also working on improving the performance of the Android version so that it would be on par with the [iOS version](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/lilypad-sales/id921371352). Cleaned up the Android user interface and started making performance improvements that made some features 60% faster.
*   Fixed bugs, upgraded existing capabilities, and added new features to the app. Built apps for both iOS and Android in JavaScript using [Axway’s](https://www.appcelerator.com/) [Titanium](https://www.appcelerator.com/Titanium/) SDK (formerly known as Appcelerator Titanium).
*   Took charge of internal developer documentation. While Lilypad’s back end and web application were written by senior developers, the mobile app’s 360,000+ lines of source code were largely written by junior developers and interns. With managerial approval, devoted 20% of development time to writing much-needed internal documentation of the mobile app, refactoring the code, and upgrading it to a more current version of JavaScript.
*   Established coding standards for the mobile app. The mobile code was developed by a series of junior developers, each coding in their own style. Defined a standard to be used for mobile development and have applied it to the codebase during development.
*   Built a new mobile process and team: Key participant in weekly mobile development strategy meetings with the CTO to improve the mobile app development process. Interviewed developers for the mobile team.",

          "description": "Peekabooty was an anti-censorship tool announced by the hacker and do-it-yourself media organization [Cult of the Dead Cow](http://cultdeadcow.com/) at the [DefCon](https://www.defcon.org/) conference in the summer of 2001. It was a peer-to-peer encrypted proxy system that circumvented internet censorship systems such as “The Great Firewall of China”, and has since been supplanted by VPN and similar anti-censorship technologies.

Even though it was announced, the project wasn’t actually implemented until Paul Baranowski and I worked on it starting December 2001, and presented it at the CodeCon conference in February 2002. Paul was the back-end developer, building the underlying networking software, while I was the front-end developer, and built and designed the user interface, which included the cute bear icons that the screen used to show other users on the network.

Peekabooty got a considerable amount of press at the time. Here’s a short list of articles: - _The Register:_ [Censor-buster Peek-A-Booty goes public](http://www.theregister.co.uk/2002/02/18/censorbuster_peeka_booty_goes_public/) - _Neowin:_ [Peek-A-Booty raises a few eyebrows at CodeCon](https://www.neowin.net/news/peek-a-booty-raises-a-few-eyebrows-at-codecon) - From the book _[Hacktivism and Cyberwars: Rebels with a Cause?:](https://www.amazon.com/Hacktivism-Cyberwars-Rebels-Tim-Jordan/dp/0415260043/ref=sr_1_1)_ I am briefly mentioned on page 102 for my involvement with Peekabooty. - _Spiegel Online:_ [Vorhang auf für Peek a Booty:](http://www.spiegel.de/netzwelt/tech/im-zeichen-des-teddies-vorhang-auf-fuer-peek-a-booty-a-183280.html) Peekabooty, as covered by the online version of the German news magazine _Der Spiegel_.",

If we gave you a quick programming assignment, which would you prefer — writing an iOS app, or an Android app? You should go with the one you’re stronger in.”

I’m a much stronger iOS programmer than an Android one. The smart move would’ve been to answer “iOS,” and be done with it.

Instead, I replied “Yes, but you want a guy who can lead a team of both iOS and Android developers. You really should give me both.”

The CTO raised an eyebrow, gave me a look, made a note on his pad, and said “Hmmm...I think I will.”

This is either a “total baller move” (to borrow a turn of phrase the kids are using these day), or the end of that job prospect. But for the job that they’re trying to fill, taking on that challenge was the right thing to do.

It had been a couple of years since I’d touched C or Objective-C, but after bumping my head once or twice against C-isms (“Oh yeah, pointers”), I got into a groove and a few days later, I had an app that I could show them.

I sent them my project files for the iOS app, along with this “highlight reel” of the app in action, which I made using Camtasia Studio. “Tell me what you think while I work on the Android version.”

And that’s the last I heard from them. Follow-up emails were met with silence. After the 6th email (“If you have any questions or comments about the app, please feel free to contact me”), it became apparent that this was a dead end, and it wouldn’t be worth my while to continue working on the Android version. Perhaps I’ll work on it as a way to sharpen my Kotlin skills.",
