        <span class="description-content-full"><p>We were ninety minutes into a one-hour job interview when the CTO said “We like your <em>breadth</em> of experience. Now we’d like to test your <em>depth</em>. If we gave you a quick programming assignment, which would you prefer — writing an iOS app, or an Android app? You should go with the one you’re stronger in.”</p>

<p>I’m a much stronger iOS programmer than an Android one. The smart move would’ve been to answer “iOS,” and be done with it.</p>

<p>Instead, I replied “Yes, but you want a guy who can lead a team of both iOS and Android developers. You really should give me both.”</p>

<p>The CTO raised an eyebrow, gave me a look, made a note on his pad, and said “Hmmm...I think I will.”</p>

<p>This is either a “total baller move” (to borrow a turn of phrase the kids are using these day), or the end of that job prospect. But for the job that they’re trying to fill, taking on that challenge was the right thing to do.</p>

<p>It had been a couple of years since I’d touched C or Objective-C, but after bumping my head once or twice against C-isms (“Oh yeah, pointers”), I got into a groove and a few days later, I had an app that I could show them.</p>

<p>I sent them my project files for the iOS app, along with this “highlight reel” of the app in action, which I made using Camtasia Studio. “Tell me what you think while I work on the Android version.”</p>

<p>And that’s the last I heard from them. Follow-up emails were met with silence. After the 6th email (“If you have any questions or comments about the app, please feel free to contact me”), it became apparent that this was a dead end, and it wouldn’t be worth my while to continue working on the Android version. Perhaps I’ll work on it as a way to sharpen my Kotlin skills.</p>

<p>In addition to coming up with the topic and title for the webinar, I wrote the script, hosted the webinar, and produced the video based on the recording and Honeywell’s slides.</p>

In it, I sang the praises of "Florida Man" and "Florida Woman", those staples of slow news days and internet memes, and showed how they're this state's most valuable resource, complete with Florida Man logic and a closing accordion number. </p>

<p>This was a presentation given in the "Ignite" format. It's 5 minutes long, with 20 slides, each slide advancing automatically every 15 seconds. The format has been described as "the presentation equivalent of a haiku or sonnet." They're more challenging than your typical presentation, and require more rehearsal -- and they're also more thrilling to give!</p>

I’d heard that Google wasn’t going to sponsor them, and asked: <em>_Why doesn’t Microsoft sponsor them instead?_</em></p>

<p>I used the event as an opportunity to showcase Windows as a great development platform for Android, by demoing an HP touchscreen computer set up as an Android development station running Eclipse (which at the time was the preferred Android IDE) and also showing the Windows Phone development environment, which looked a lot less confusing and more aesthetically pleasing than Eclipse (although that’s easy), and showing the C# language (similar to Java, so it seems familiar) and Windows Phone in the process.</p>

It was a peer-to-peer encrypted proxy system that circumvented internet censorship systems such as “The Great Firewall of China”, and has since been supplanted by VPN and similar anti-censorship technologies.</p>

<p>Even though it was announced, the project wasn’t actually implemented until Paul Baranowski and I worked on it starting December 2001, and presented it at the CodeCon conference in February 2002. Paul was the back-end developer, building the underlying networking software, while I was the front-end developer, and built and designed the user interface, which included the cute bear icons that the screen used to show other users on the network.</p>

<p>Peekabooty got a considerable amount of press at the time. Here’s a short list of articles:

                    <p>In my spare time, to keep my hand in “the programming game”, I take on mobile app development side projects for people with interesting app ideas. My primary development platform is iOS, although I can also develop Android apps, as well as cross-platform apps using Xamarin. Recent projects include:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/aspirations-winerys-wine-crush/id1131103492?mt=8" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Aspirations Winery’s Wine Crush</a>: A free iOS app written to promote a friend’s winery and wine shop in Clearwater, Florida. It’s a wine-themed game in the style of Candy Crush, and a promotional tool that other wineries won't have. It's available for free on the App Store. Unlike other free games, there aren't any "poison pills" to extract money from players — this game's just about simple, unadulterated fun.
•   Mind Quieting, an audio player that guides the user through mind quieting exercises developed by Dr. Alan Banack, a Toronto-based psychotherapist, and based on techniques developed over years of working with patients to help counter stress.</li>

<ul>
<li>Owned and delivered a major upgrade to the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.lilypadsolutions.lilypadappV2&amp;hl=en_US" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Android version of Lilypad</a>, bringing it to feature parity with the iOS version. I was also working on improving the performance of the Android version so that it would be on par with the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/lilypad-sales/id921371352" rel="nofollow noreferrer">iOS version</a>. Cleaned up the Android user interface and started making performance improvements that made some features 60% faster.</li>
<li>Fixed bugs, upgraded existing capabilities, and added new features to the app. Built apps for both iOS and Android in JavaScript using <a href="https://www.appcelerator.com/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Axway’s</a> <a href="https://www.appcelerator.com/Titanium/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Titanium</a> SDK (formerly known as Appcelerator Titanium).</li>
<li>Took charge of internal developer documentation. While Lilypad’s back end and web application were written by senior developers, the mobile app’s 360,000+ lines of source code were largely written by junior developers and interns. With managerial approval, devoted 20% of development time to writing much-needed internal documentation of the mobile app, refactoring the code, and upgrading it to a more current version of JavaScript.</li>
<li>Established coding standards for the mobile app. The mobile code was developed by a series of junior developers, each coding in their own style. Defined a standard to be used for mobile development and have applied it to the codebase during development.</li>
<li>Built a new mobile process and team: Key participant in weekly mobile development strategy meetings with the CTO to improve the mobile app development process. Interviewed developers for the mobile team.</li>

                    <p>We were ninety minutes into a one-hour job interview when the CTO said “We like your <em>breadth</em> of experience. Now we’d like to test your <em>depth</em>. If we gave you a quick programming assignment, which would you prefer — writing an iOS app, or an Android app? You should go with the one you’re stronger in.”</p>

<p>I’m a much stronger iOS programmer than an Android one. The smart move would’ve been to answer “iOS,” and be done with it.</p>

<p>Instead, I replied “Yes, but you want a guy who can lead a team of both iOS and Android developers. You really should give me both.”</p>

<p>The CTO raised an eyebrow, gave me a look, made a note on his pad, and said “Hmmm...I think I will.”</p>

<p>This is either a “total baller move” (to borrow a turn of phrase the kids are using these day), or the end of that job prospect. But for the job that they’re trying to fill, taking on that challenge was the right thing to do.</p>

<p>It had been a couple of years since I’d touched C or Objective-C, but after bumping my head once or twice against C-isms (“Oh yeah, pointers”), I got into a groove and a few days later, I had an app that I could show them.</p>

<p>I sent them my project files for the iOS app, along with this “highlight reel” of the app in action, which I made using Camtasia Studio. “Tell me what you think while I work on the Android version.”</p>

<p>And that’s the last I heard from them. Follow-up emails were met with silence. After the 6th email (“If you have any questions or comments about the app, please feel free to contact me”), it became apparent that this was a dead end, and it wouldn’t be worth my while to continue working on the Android version. Perhaps I’ll work on it as a way to sharpen my Kotlin skills.</p>

In it, I sang the praises of "Florida Man" and "Florida Woman", those staples of slow news days and internet memes, and showed how they're this state's most valuable resource, complete with Florida Man logic and a closing accordion number. </p>

<p>This was a presentation given in the "Ignite" format. It's 5 minutes long, with 20 slides, each slide advancing automatically every 15 seconds. The format has been described as "the presentation equivalent of a haiku or sonnet." They're more challenging than your typical presentation, and require more rehearsal -- and they're also more thrilling to give!</p>

                    <p>In October 2010, Toronto’s <a href="http://androidto.com/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">AndroidTO</a> conference needed a couple of big sponsors to help ensure that they could hold their day-long, hundreds-of-attendees event without losing money. I’d heard that Google wasn’t going to sponsor them, and asked: <em>_Why doesn’t Microsoft sponsor them instead?_</em></p>

<p>I used the event as an opportunity to showcase Windows as a great development platform for Android, by demoing an HP touchscreen computer set up as an Android development station running Eclipse (which at the time was the preferred Android IDE) and also showing the Windows Phone development environment, which looked a lot less confusing and more aesthetically pleasing than Eclipse (although that’s easy), and showing the C# language (similar to Java, so it seems familiar) and Windows Phone in the process.</p>

<p>I got to work, and the result is this 5-minute, 46-second piece that summarizes the web world in the summer of 2010. I wrote, designed, narrated, and as the credits say, hastily produced this video, and my coworker was able to present it the following evening.</p>

<p>This Byte Club episode covered DemoCamp Toronto, a monthly show-and-tell gathering where Toronto techies could demo their projects in front of an audience of their peers. I was one of the people who co-hosted these gatherings.</p>

<p>You had a time limit to present, and no slides were allowed at DemoCamp — you could only show your project in action!</p>

                    <p>Peekabooty was an anti-censorship tool announced by the hacker and do-it-yourself media organization <a href="http://cultdeadcow.com/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Cult of the Dead Cow</a> at the <a href="https://www.defcon.org/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">DefCon</a> conference in the summer of 2001. It was a peer-to-peer encrypted proxy system that circumvented internet censorship systems such as “The Great Firewall of China”, and has since been supplanted by VPN and similar anti-censorship technologies.</p>

<p>Even though it was announced, the project wasn’t actually implemented until Paul Baranowski and I worked on it starting December 2001, and presented it at the CodeCon conference in February 2002. Paul was the back-end developer, building the underlying networking software, while I was the front-end developer, and built and designed the user interface, which included the cute bear icons that the screen used to show other users on the network.</p>

<p>Peekabooty got a considerable amount of press at the time. Here’s a short list of articles:
